# T-Market
T-Market is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) which is constantly running and will always give a price for the listed pairs. What sets T-Market apart from other AMMs is that it is integrated into Trusted Circles, where there is a degree of granularity that can be applied to listed trading pairs and who has permission to trade. From the app it is easy to add liquidity, if the Trusted Circle rules permit you to, and to place trades.
