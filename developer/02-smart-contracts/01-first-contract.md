# Your First Contract

We will now get first-hand experience with Tgrade Smart Contracting experience.

Tgrade is built using modular technology: [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/), [Cosmos SDK](https://cosmos.network/) and [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/). 
This documentation focuses on CosmWasm part of the stack where the smart contract engine lives. So keep the rest of the stack out of your focus during this documentation.

We will not dive into smart contract development in this section to provide an easy to digest introduction. Also, you
can follow the steps here to test out smart contracts live on a testnet without drowning in smart contract development
details. We will demonstrate setting up environment, compiling, deploying, and interacting. 

This is designed for programmers who are comfortable with the command-line and using Linux or MacOS. It is helpful to
have a basic understanding of Rust and Go, but we will lead you through, so fast learners need no prior knowledge.

## Sections {#sections}

[Installation](02-installation.md) will show you how to setup the required software tooling for CosmWasm.

[Setting up Environment](03-setting-env.md) will show you how to setup the client environment, interacting with faucet.

[Downloading and Compiling Contract](04-compile-contract.md) will demonstrate downloading and compiling smart contract code
to wasm byte code.

[Interacting with Contracts](05-interact-with-contract.md) will show deploying, initializing and executing smart contracts.

[Next Steps](06-next-steps.md) is the last part of the tutorial that wraps up and sails you to the next dock, meaning new
learning resources.

## Video Version {#video-version}

The coding sections for smart contracts are also available as
a [series of videos, leading you through the code structure](https://vimeo.com/showcase/6671477).
